/**
 * An arrow in the air: it chases what it was loosed at, and hurts it on arrival.
 *
 * <p>Chases rather than flies at a point, which is a decision and not an
 * oversight. A shot that led its target would miss whenever the target turned,
 * and a dungeon full of arrows thudding into walls behind fleeing monsters is a
 * different game — one where the hero's range is a suggestion. It follows, so the
 * shot always arrives; what the flight costs is time.
 *
 * <p>It carries the damage rather than working it out on landing. The figure was
 * final when the weapon let go of it, and the archer may have levelled — or died —
 * in the third of a second since.
 *
 * <p>No body and no geometry, on purpose. Nothing can shoot at it, because
 * weapons only acquire things with a body; and it passes through the world rather
 * than shouldering monsters aside on its way past.
