/**
 * A monster's level, and the two multipliers it gives: how much harder it hits, and what its health was grown by.
 *
 * <p>Attached where the monster is placed, or rises, rather than written into its template, because the same Runner
 * stands at every level and only where it was met is different: see {@code Spawner.scale}, the one step that makes a
 * creature its level. A template is what a thing is; this is where it was found. A creature that carries none -- a
 * test's bare skeleton -- is level 1, its block exactly.
 *
 * <p>Rides the engine's {@link DamageModifier} seam for its weapon's blow, which is exactly the case that seam was
 * opened for: a bonus belonging to one unit rather than to its whole side, from a module the engine has never heard
 * of. Read by its skills too, which deal their own damage rather than going through the weapon (see
 * {@code SkillBook}); by the rifts it opens, so what climbs out stands at its level (see {@code SummoningUpdate}); and
 * by the card that shows what it hits for.
