/**
 * One thing that can be found on a dungeon floor, as the data file describes it, at the level it has been joined to.
 *
 * <p>Data and nothing else: a new item is a LootItem block in {@code data/world/world.duke} and no
 * Java at all.
 *
 * <p>{@code name} is finished words — the client writes none of its own, here as
 * everywhere else — and for the same reason it may not carry the two characters
 * the status line separates its fields with.
 *
 * <p><b>Three alike are one of the next level.</b> A thing is found at the first level; three of the same thing at
 * the same level in one bag become one of the next, worth the three of them together — its figure and its extra
 * — and at the second level the extra begins. See {@link #joined}.
 *
 * @param id         what the block is headed by; never seen by the player
 * @param name       what it is called when he picks it up and when the pointer rests on
 *                   it, in the game's own language
 * @param icon       the picture his bag draws it with, a path from the resource root
 * @param kind       which figure it moves
 * @param value      percent for {@code ATTACK} and {@code ARMOUR}, flat health or mana
 *                   for {@code HEALTH} and {@code MANA}, whole points for
 *                   {@code ATTRIBUTE} — at this level
 * @param weight     how often it is the one that drops; zero is never
 * @param minDepth   the floor below which it is not found at all, which is what
 *                   makes going deeper worth the monsters
 * @param attribute  which attribute an {@code ATTRIBUTE} item gives, as a hero's block
 *                   names it; empty for every other kind
 * @param extra      what it gives beside its figure from the second level on
 * @param extraValue how much of it, at this level: nothing at the first
 * @param extraStep  how much of it the second level brings
 * @param level      how many times it has been joined, and one: found at 1
 * @param use        what a left click on it in the bag does
 * @param liesAs     the template it lies on the floor as; blank for the chest everything else lies in
