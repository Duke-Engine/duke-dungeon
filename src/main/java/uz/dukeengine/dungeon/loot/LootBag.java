/**
 * What the hero carries: a few slots, each empty or holding one thing he picked up off the floor, and what it all
 * comes to.
 *
 * <p>Session state, beside {@link uz.dukeengine.dungeon.level.HeroProgress} and for the
 * same reasons: a floor
 * gives him a new body, and a sword he found has to survive that; a death is
 * meant to take everything, and is told rather than left to infer.
 *
 * <p>What is in it counts for as long as it is in it. He picks a thing up by being sent to it, and puts one down
 * the same way — see {@link ItemErrand} — and a full bag leaves the next thing lying where it was. Three of the
 * same thing at the same level join into one of the next, up to the top level: see {@link #take}.
 *
 * <p>Written on the simulation thread only. The window reads {@link #slots()}, a copy taken each time the bag
 * changes, and {@link #noteAt}, whose words and frame are one value — so it never sees either half-changed.
 *
 * <p>It also carries the words for the last thing he found, because something has
 * to say so and the run loop is what writes the line the panel reads.
