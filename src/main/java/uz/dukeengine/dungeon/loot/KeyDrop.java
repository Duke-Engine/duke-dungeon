/**
 * What a hero leaves where he falls: the key, if he carries it — so a party never loses the way on with him, and the

 *
 * <p>Hung on the engine's {@link DieModule} seam, as a monster's {@link LootDrop} is and for the same reason: it runs
 * once he has left the world, and what it lays lies where he fell. Everything else in his bag stays his, for when he
 * stands again — and so does a key that cannot be laid, one whose template nobody has made: it is laid first, and
 * leaves his bag only once something lies where it fell, so it is never lost between the bag and the floor.
