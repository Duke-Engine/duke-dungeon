/**
 * A rift in the floor that one of the dungeon's own is about to climb out of.
 *
 * <p>The bargain the meteor's mark and the healer's light strike: it lies where it was
 * opened for a moment, a thing in the world, and when it lands the creature rises there
 * -- so the client draws the column going up on the frame the creature appears, and the
 * fog hides both.
 *
 * <p>What climbs out is marked as called up ({@link Summoned}): it falls down again when
 * its time is out, it stands at its caller's level, it is worth the share of experience
 * the skill says of what its kind is worth there, and it counts against its caller's
 * {@code MaxSummoned} for as long as it stands.
