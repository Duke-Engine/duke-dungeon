/**
 * The kinds of thing a skill can do.
 *
 * <p>The one place skills need Java. Everything else about them — which hero has
 * them, which key casts them, how hard they hit, how long they take to come back,
 * how they grow with a level — is written in his own file, so a second hero
 * with a different four is a file change and nothing more.
 *
 * <p>These are the shapes a dungeon hero needs: hit one thing hard, hit
 * everything near you, drop something on a spot, fire something down a line, be
 * somewhere else, be briefly stronger, be briefly harder to kill -- and three that
 * no hero has and a monster does: mend one of your own, call up more of them, and
 * make one of them strike faster.
 * And some that are never cast at all: drink from your own blows, and lend
 * everyone of your own round you something -- see {@link #isPassive} and
 * {@link #isAura}. A new shape is
 * a constant here and one branch in {@link SkillBook}; a new <em>skill</em> is
 * neither, and that is the point of the split — a second hero is blocks of INI
 * and no Java at all.
 *
 * <p>Two of them do double duty rather than having been split in half, and the
 * file decides which: {@link #AREA_DAMAGE} lands once or goes on landing, and
 * {@link #DASH} carries him harmlessly or through whoever is in the way. Both are
 * the same shape at two settings, so a knight's whirlwind and an archer's sprint
 * cost no new constant here and leave every existing skill exactly as it was.
 *
 * <p>Each carries what the player has to point at before it can be cast. That is
 * a property of the effect rather than of the skill: a strike is aimed at
 * something whatever its numbers say, and there is no useful sense in which one
 * hero's dash is aimed and another's is not.

     * <p>It cannot land inside stone — somewhere he could not stand is not

     *
     * <p><b>Where this actually differs from {@link #DASH}, since both of them
     * arrive in one frame.</b> The dash was already written to clear what is
     * between it and its landing, so "goes over the wall" is not the difference
     * and it would be pleasant nonsense to say that it is. Three things are:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>It never hurts anything. A dash with a {@code Damage} tramples what
     *       it crossed; this has no such reading, so a blink cannot be tuned into
     *       a charge by a file.
     *   <li>It goes exactly where it was pointed, along the line from him to the
     *       click. A dash goes along his FACING, which is turned toward the click
     *       first and is near enough — but near enough is not the same thing, and
     *       an escape is a skill you want to land on the tile you picked.
     *   <li>It refuses rather than shrugging. A dash with nowhere to come down
     *       leaves him standing where he was and spends the cooldown anyway --
     *       though a dash too is refused, nothing spent, where it would come
     *       down on the far side of the keep's shut gate, as a blink is: see
     *       {@code Seal}.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The fourth difference is the client's and is the one a player will
     * actually name: a dash is drawn travelling and a blink is drawn as two
     * flashes with nothing in between.
