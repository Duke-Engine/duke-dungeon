/**
 * The skills a hero has, what they are doing right now, and how long until he can
 * do them again.
 *
 * <p>Written here rather than built on the engine's {@code SpecialPowerModule},
 * which is a superweapon: one shape (area damage at a map point), values frozen
 * when the unit is built, no notion of a level unlocking anything, and four of
 * them on one unit are not tellable apart. Every one of those is something a
 * dungeon skill needs, so this follows {@code GrowableBody} and {@code HeroProgress}
 * — the game writes its own rule and the engine stays out of it.
 *
 * <p>What it does borrow is {@link DamageModifier}, and this module implements it
 * directly rather than attaching a buff module while {@code EMPOWER} lasts.
 * Attaching and detaching a module mid-frame is exactly what the engine's module
 * list refuses (rightly — it would silently skip whatever came next), and a flag
 * that expires is the same thing without the trap. A {@code HASTE} is held the
 * same way, in the hastened's own book, which is a {@link RateOfFireModifier} for
 * it -- the seam a hero's boots ride through {@code AttackSpeed} -- and every
 * monster carries one from birth.
 *
 * <p>Determinism: cooldowns are frames counted down, never seconds; the victim of
 * a {@code STRIKE} is the nearest enemy with ties broken by object id, and the one
 * a {@code HASTE} is for the sturdiest near, down to the object id; a
 * {@code DASH} walks with {@link StrictMath}. Nothing here asks the clock.
