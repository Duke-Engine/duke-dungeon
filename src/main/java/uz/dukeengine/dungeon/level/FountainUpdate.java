/**
 * Water that mends whoever stands near it: every so often, every living thing within its reach is given back a
 * share of its health and of its mana — the heroes, and the dungeon's own as well, so a fight beside the fountain
 * is one the monsters get their breath back in too.
 *
 * <p>A share of each one's own figures rather than a number of points, so it is worth the same on the first floor
 * as on the tenth, to a rogue as to a knight. And a pulse rather than a trickle: the numbers the client pops over a
 * mended head are how the player learns what the fountain does.
 *
 * <p>Like every mending, it does not cross the keep's shut gate: it reaches only those on its own side of it — see
 * {@link Seal}. The way-in fountain stands far from any keep, but that is only where a floor puts it today, and the
 * water asks all the same.
 *
 * <p>Deterministic: counted on the world's own frame, and each gift a whole number of points worked out from the
 * thing's own figures, the same on every machine.
