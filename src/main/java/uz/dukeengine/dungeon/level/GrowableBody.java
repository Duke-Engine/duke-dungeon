/**
 * A body whose maximum health and armour can change after it is built.
 *
 * <p>The engine's {@code ActiveBody} fixes maximum health and armour when the
 * unit is created, which is right for an RTS where a rifleman is a rifleman.
 * A roguelike hero is the other case: the whole game is him becoming harder to
 * kill. Rather than change the engine's body, the game supplies its own through
 * the module seam the engine already offers — which is what that seam is for.
 *
 * <p>Armour is one multiplier over every damage type, named or not: the engine's
 * damage types are an open set, so a hero who has earned protection is protected
 * from whatever the dungeon later learns to throw.
 *
 * <p>Growing raises current health by the same amount it raises the maximum. A
 * full heal on level-up would make levelling a free escape from a losing fight,
 * which turns "keep killing" into a way of avoiding the fight rather than a
 * reward for winning it.
